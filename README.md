# COSC411 - Artificial Intelligence Projects
## Salisbury University

This repository contains projects developed for COSC411 (Artificial Intelligence) at Salisbury University. These projects demonstrate various AI algorithms and problem-solving techniques.

## Projects

### 1. Fifteen Puzzle Solver (A* Search)
A sophisticated implementation of the classic 15-puzzle game with an AI solver using the A* search algorithm. The solver employs multiple heuristic techniques to find optimal solutions efficiently:

- **Advanced Heuristics**:
  - Manhattan Distance
  - Linear Conflicts Detection
  - Pattern Database
  - Combined Weighted Heuristics

**Key Features:**
- Interactive GUI built with PyQt5
- Automatic puzzle solver using A* search
- Multiple heuristic functions for optimal pathfinding
- Solution animation and step tracking
- Performance optimizations for faster solving



### 2. Graph Path Search
An implementation of various graph search algorithms to find optimal paths between cities in the United States. The project visualizes and compares different search strategies.

**Features:**
- Multiple search algorithms:
  - Depth-First Search (DFS)
  - Breadth-First Search (BFS)
  - A* Search
- Real distance calculations between cities
- Path visualization
- Performance metrics:
  - Execution time
  - Path length
  - Visited nodes

Example output from DFS search (Buffalo to Richmond):
```
Execution Time: 0.00037932395935058594
Path To Target: ['Buffalo', 'Pittsburgh', 'NewYork', 'Philadelphia', 'Salisbury', 'Norfolk', 'Richmond']
Distance Of Path: 1046
Visted Nodes: ['Buffalo', 'Pittsburgh', 'NewYork', 'Philadelphia', 'Salisbury', 'Norfolk', 'Richmond']
Total Distance: 1046
```
